# Lead API challenge

## Purpose

This an API that allows you to create users named "usuarios" and create leads for the users. There are three possible leads:

1. Auto
2. Casa
3. Nomina

mongo ATLAS
NODE 
DOCKER?

The solution has 4 main endpoints:

1. /usuarios
2. /autos
3. /casas
4. /nominas

## Usage

To use this api you have two options. Directly executing the code on your machine or use a docker container.

### Local machine execution

1. Clone the repository.
2. Get into the directory.
3. Open a terminal in the same directory as these files and run the following commands to install the libraries
  - `npm install express --save`
  - `npm install body-parser --save`
  - `npm install mongoose --save`
4. Start the server running `node srver.js`. It will be using port 5000.

### Docker container

1. Clone the repository.
2. Get into the directory.
3. Run the command `docker build -t IMAGE_NAME:TAG .`. This command will create the image using dockerfile within the repository. You can create your own image if desired. IMAGE_NAME is the name for the new image and TAG is used as a version, an example could be `lead_api/node:v1.0`
4. To run a container use command `docker run -d -p HOST_PORT:5000 IMAGE_NAME:TAG`. HOST_PORT will be the port you are willing to use on your server.

-----------------------------------------
### Future improvement notes

1. Use RFC to match the leads to a user instead of mongo object ID.
2. When a user is deleted, delete first all the leads under his domain.
3. For the auto valuation, instead of sending the auto price, use another collection with registered models and prices.
4. For casa leads, address can be separated in granular fields to simply check a value instead of searching a perfect match on all the string.
5. Nomina lead could use separate fields for month, day and year. This to work with a more exact calculation of 14 months instead of 420 days using 30 days as a month.
6. PUT method was implemented as excersice and possible usage. At the moment it only updates values, but not the acecpted or rejected status. If it is possible and prefered to edit and change the status over generating a new lead, this could be modified. Otherwise, deleted and send an error message.
7. There is no login capability. Could be added to the root endpoint "/" as it only displays a message to use other endpoint.
